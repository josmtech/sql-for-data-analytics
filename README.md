# sql-for-data-analytics
I am using this repository to learn data analytics using sql and do practice projects

The select statement is used together with table columns to choose what to be included in the output. The asterik * is used to select and display all columns in the output. Select can be followed by specific column names like "first_name" "age" etc.

The where clause is used to filter the rows of the column specified according to the condition give. Like is used to set a condition which doesnt need to be exclusively met
eg like firstname = "Jer%" accepts all firstnames starting with Jer
like firstname = "%er%" accepts all entries with er in tany position of firstname
like firstname = "J__" will accept names starting with J followed by exactly to characters. a % sign can be added after the underscore to include more characters.
