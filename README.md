I am using this repository to learn data analytics using sql and do practice projects

BEGINNER SQL

The select statement is used together with table columns to choose what to be included in the output. The asterik * is used to select and display all columns in the output. Select can be followed by specific column names like "first_name" "age" etc.

The where clause is used to filter the rows of the column specified according to the condition give. 
Like is used to set a condition which doesnt need to be exclusively met
eg like firstname = "Jer%" accepts all firstnames starting with Jer
like firstname = "%er%" accepts all entries with er in tany position of firstname
like firstname = "J__" will accept names starting with J followed by exactly to characters. 
a % sign can be added after the underscore to include more characters.

The group by statement is used to group together any rows of a column with the same value stored in 
them, based on a function specified in the statement

The ORDER BY clause in SQL is used to sort the result set of a query in a specific order based on one 
or more columns. This clause is commonly used to arrange data in ascending or descending order, 
allowing you to control the presentation of data for better analysis and readability.


limits are used to set the maximum number of lines to be displayed in the output. they can be 
used together with others like order by to make the ouput more apppealing and give more clearer.

Aliasing is used to give alternative names for columns in the output or for giving names for 
aggregate columns instead of having the functions as column names.
